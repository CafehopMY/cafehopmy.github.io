<p>3.4          Tracking and Targeting Policy</p>
<p>CafeHop MY (we, us or our) collects data about your browsing activity on our network. We may also use non-personal information that we collect about you on our network to identify you on third party websites where we have an arrangement in place to serve ads on those third party websites. We may also collect anonymous internet usage data from third parties.</p>
<p>One of the reasons we collect usage data is to display targeted advertisements or content on our network and also on third party websites. For that purpose, usage data may be collected and assigned to one or more pre-defined categories (for example “brewed coffee”). If this infers a particular interest, a cookie is placed in your web browser which may determine the type of targeted advertising or content that you receive. We target advertisements and content in order to improve your user experience – so that you are served advertisements and content that we believe may be more relevant or useful to you.</p>
<p>To create consumer profiles we also collate anonymous data from other sources across our network, including memberships, surveys or competitions. However, we will not combine usage data with your personal information or share your personal information with any third party, except in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Advertisements or content may also be “targeted” to users based on:</p>
<p>the type of content displayed on a given web page;
the geographical location of a user (ie. identified by an IP address); or
specific searches undertaken by a user.
Other reasons we may collect anonymous usage data include:</p>
<p>to limit the number of times users are served certain ads;
to monitor the performance of advertising campaigns;
to audit, research, and analyse usage in order to maintain and improve our services, and to develop new services; and
to ensure that our ad-serving technologies function properly.
We will not collect usage data or target advertisements based on the following market segments:</p>
<p>racial or ethnic origin; or
political opinions; or
membership of a political association; or
religious beliefs or affiliations; or
philosophical beliefs; or
membership of a professional or trade association; or
membership of a trade union; or
sexual preferences or practices; or
criminal record; or
health information; or
genetic information that is not otherwise health information.
If we ever seek to target advertisements based on the above market segments, we will first obtain your consent.</p>
<p>We will not create categories designed to target children under the age of 13 years (however, this does not prevent us from marketing children’s products to an adult audience).</p>
<p>Third party advertisers purchase advertising products from us that enable them to target particular types of users of our network, for advertisements served both on our network and also on third party websites.</p>
<p>We will not provide any personal information to an advertiser or any other third party without your consent or in accordance with our Privacy Policy. However, to the extent that anonymous user data does not constitute personal information, we are entitled to deal with that information in any manner we see fit.</p>
<p>For more information regarding how we treat personal information and, in some cases, non-personal information, please refer to our Personal Data Protection Notice and Privacy Policy in Section 3 hereof.</p>
<p>3.5          Transfer of Personal Data</p>
<p>Your personal data may from time to time be transferred to, stored, used and processed by us in places other than Malaysia. This is because some of our digital storage facilities and servers may be located in such other places.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, your personal data may also be transferred out of Malaysia to third parties like those set out Section 3.3 hereof and you hereby consent to the transfer of your personal data out of Malaysia as set out above.</p>
