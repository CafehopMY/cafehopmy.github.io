            "question": "Are you guys a cafe?",
            "answer": "Nope. But we help cafes connect to people by curating a list of cafes around Malaysia! Use our maps to find a cafe with nice people hopefully. With enough interest, maybe one day, we will have a cafe to screen films, have photo exhibitions, run our own tech company, serve fine teas and coffee and have a design studio in it. *sigh*"

        {
            "question": "Are you guys like an organisation of hipster cafes?",
            "answer": "Um, we’re not. Cafe Hop is a project registered under Mindful Wanderers LLP (LLP0002651-LGN). There is an association for <a href='https://www.facebook.com/MalaysiaSpecialtyCoffeeAssociation'>Malaysia Speciality Coffee</a> but if there is help you need with, you can always drop us a line at <a>cafehopkl [at] gmail.com</a>."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you guys pick cafes into the map?",
            "answer": "In our spare time, we check some places out and decide based on good ambience, good food, good coffee and/or good service. We have a weak spot for independent run (read: not a chain/franchise/licencee) and local do-good cafes. "
        },
        {
            "question": "I own a cafe. Pick me! How do I get into your map?",
            "answer": "We will find you or you can try your luck and drop us an email at <a>cafehopkl [at] gmail.com</a>. We try to be anonymous about our visits and don’t expect to be treated any special. We just want more choice of good coffee/food/ambience/service for everyone. :) "
        },
        {
            "question": "How often do you update your map?",
            "answer": "As often as the full moon rises or whenever we can get down to it. "
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you guys make money?",
            "answer": "We convert caffeine into ideas and from these ideas come money. Hopefully. Soon. Any time now, please."

            "question": "Do you guys do coffee pop-ups, coffee catering, coffee sharing and appreciation classes?",
            "answer": "No but our sister project : Spacebar Coffee might. Look us up at <a href='http://spacebarcoffee.wordpress.com'>spacebarcoffee.wordpress.com</a>."
