"Are you guys a cafe?"
Nope. But we help cafes connect to people by curating a list of cafes around Malaysia! Use our maps to find a cafe with nice people hopefully. 

With enough interest, maybe one day, we will have a cafe to screen films, have photo exhibitions, run our own tech company, serve fine teas and coffee and have a design studio in it. *sigh*

"Are you guys like an organisation of hipster cafes?" 
Um, we’re not. Cafe Hop is a project registered under Mindful Wanderers LLP (LLP0002651-LGN). There is an association for Malaysia Speciality Coffee (https://www.facebook.com/MalaysiaSpecialtyCoffeeAssociation) but if there is help you need with, you can always drop us a line at cafehopkl[at]gmail.com.

“How do you guys pick cafes into the map?”
In our spare time, we check some places out and decide based on good ambience, good food, good coffee and/or good service. We have a weak spot for independent run (read: not a chain/franchise/licencee) and local do-good cafes.

“I own a cafe. Pick me! How do I get into your map?”
We will find you or you can try your luck and drop us an email at cafehopkl[at]gmail.com. We try to be anonymous about our visits and don’t expect to be treated any special. We just want more choice of good coffee/food/ambience/service for everyone. :)

“How often do you update your map?”
As often as the full moon rises or whenever we can get down to it. 

---

“How do you guys make money?”
We convert caffeine into ideas and from these ideas come money. Hopefully. Soon. Any time now, please.

---

“Are you guys psychic?”
We know what you’re thinking.

“Do you guys do coffee pop-ups, coffee catering, coffee sharing and appreciation classes?”
No but our sister project : Spacebar Coffee might. Look us up here: spacebarcoffee.wordpress.com.
