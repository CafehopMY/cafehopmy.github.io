Now, a coffee lover, after visiting over 70 cafes around Malaysia, he thought why not a map of cafes in Malaysia? If Joachim was a coffee drink, he would be Cham (mixed) tea and coffee with milk because sometimes he doesn't know what he is - Am I a tea that is mixed with coffee or a coffee mixed with tea? Or maybe a milk posing as a coffee mixed with tea. Perplexing.",

If Jamie was a coffee, she would be a latte - she ain't latte-ing you down *wink*",
